      <h1 class="titles">Work Experience</h1>
      <p class="work-experience">I have a lot of experience from many places. <br> <br> First I work as a student athletic photogrpaher at LSU. This job gives me the opportunity to get experince photographing every sport LSU has to offer.  This lets me find which sports I am the best at because each on is so different.  My favorites are gymnastics and baseball. Gymnastics is just so different than every other sport LSU has to offer.  I also understand it best because I spent years of my life competing. <br> <br> Another job that I currently have is being an  assistant for a local wedding photographer Whitney Wiliston. In this job I help second shoot wedding when she needs it. Most of my job with her is helping with the backend of photography. I help get her blogs up and manage her social media. <br> <br> Lastly, I am a full time student who is trying to start up her own photography business. This takes a lot of time, so I am hoping that by the time I graduate LSU I will have created a strong list of clientele and will be able to persue Sierra Beaulieu Photography full time.   </p>
